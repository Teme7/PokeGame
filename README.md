# PokeGame

Pokemon No! is a javascript game built for gamers who previously enjoyed the popular Pokemon Go! but lost their passion because of risks involved while playing. With this updated design, players can now enjoy the game without having to wander on the street or venture into the wilderness to find a Pokemon.

Thanks to the Google API, a user can simply scroll, zoom in & out of the map to discover the next unique creature. Upon clicking on the Pokemon, a battle screen opens, and the result will be determined based on the  character's assigned attack and defense points as well as user's click event. A victory or defeat gif follows each encounter to pronounce the outcome.

MySQL database keeps track of player results as well as the names & images of characters encountered, displayed in real-time at the bottom screen on the DS.

Firebase is used for users' email and password authentication.
