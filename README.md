Pokemon No! is a javascript game built for gamers who previously enjoyed the popular Pokemon Go! but lost their passion because of the risks involved while playing. With this updated design, players can now enjoy the game without having to venture into the wilderness to discover the next unique creature.

Thanks to the Google API, a user can simply scroll, zoom in and out of the map to find a pokemon and click or tap on it, upon which a battle screen opens up. Depending on the character's assigned attack and defense points, and also user's click event, the encounter yields to either victory or defeat. The result is pronounced by a gif, and user can then continue searching for yet another pokemon character. 

MySQL database keeps track of names and character encounters. 

Results will be on display instantly at the bottom screen of the DS.
