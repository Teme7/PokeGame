# PokeGame

This is the first of many javascript games I intend to build. Thanks to the Google API, a player can enjoy this game like he/she would with the popular Pokemon Go! game without having to venture into the wilderness. 

MySQL database keeps track of names and frequency of Pokemon characters encountered. Victory and defeat gifs will be displayed at conclusion of each encounter.

Firebase is used just for user authentication purposes.
