# PokeGame

This is the first of many javascript games I intend to build. Without having to leave the comfort of one's home, a player can enjoy this game like he/she would with the popular Pokemon Go game.

MySQL is to be utilized to keep track of the names and numbers of Pokemons encountered.

Firebase will be used just for user authentication purposes.
